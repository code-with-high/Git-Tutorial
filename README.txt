staging area : git add . (for to move all files or content in working area to staging area now the files able to track by version control system)

staging area : "git add <file>..." staged through file name 

staging area (staged or tracked files )  => unstaged area or untracked or in working area  =  "git rm --cached <file>"

"git restore --staged <file>..." it removes files from changes(or remove the modified file) to rollback on previous state of the version 

or 

to rollback on to the previous version after staged the modified files use the "git restore --staged <file>..."

hey see above restore from staged area
